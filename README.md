This repositry is for the porject I did on Numerical Methods in June of 
2017.
Tools Used:
Mathematica 11

Topics covered in this project:
1. Error equations of various numerical methods.
2. Developing new numerical methods and calculating their error 
equation. 
3. Using iterative methods to solve non linear equations with one 
variable.
4. Newton Fractal of cube root of unity.

Feel free to use the code in whatever way you like as long as you are 
not using for any malicious activities.
